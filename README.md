# Zoo-Classification
This is a mini fun project to learn the concept of SVM model and implementation by using zoo animals as the target variable in our model. Here we classified Crocodile and Allegators by using our SVM model.
son : "Dad is it a Crocodile or Allegator??"
Dad : "Wait son, let our machine learning model do the task for us.."
